### Classes

**`MMath`**

`MMath` is a class created to make calculations with different precision levels.

JavaScript's native `Math.sqrt` is the most precise way to calculate the square root of a number, but, due to the nature of the calculation, is rather slow.

Two additional algorithms are implemented to allow for faster, less precise calculations.

- `HIGH_PRECISION: h_root`
    - returns Native JavaScript `Math.sqrt`
    - Margin of error: `~0.00% ± 0`
    - Execution: `0.086ms`

- `MID_PRECISION: m_root`
    - Margin of error: `~0.538% ± 0.1`
    - Execution: `0.053ms`
    - `38.37%` faster

- `LOW_PRECISION: l_root`
    - Margin of error: `~1.65% ± 3`
    - Execution: `0.022ms`
    - `74.42%` faster
